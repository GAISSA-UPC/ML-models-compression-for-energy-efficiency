The research of this TFG consists of understanding how existing ML inference cloud providers optimize calculations for 
energy reduction. We will study the following aspects of ML models deployment: 

1. Energy consumption measurement after 
applying model optimization (e.g., quantization, pruning); 

2. Context-aware evaluation of the energy efficiency for 
diverse cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure).

This project was developed from January to June 2023 as a Bachelor's Degree thesis for the Data Science and Engineering 
Degree in the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya.

## Environment
To replicate this projects environment, simply run ``conda env create -f environment.yml``. This will create the 
environment (named **tfg**) and install all necessary libraries.

Once the environment is created, run ``conda activate tfg`` to activate the environment.
